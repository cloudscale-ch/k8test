#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook
#
# This playbook builds an image and makes it available to all nodes in
# the cluster. For this to work, it installs podman and builds an image
# on each node.
#
# Since podman shares its underlying storage with CRI-O, this allows us to
# make a custom image available to Kubernetes, without having to push it
# to any registry.
#
# Such images can be used in places where an `image` definition is used,
# given that the `imagePullPolicy` is set to `IfNotPresent`. Note that this
# does not work with the `latest` label though, which is always pulled.
